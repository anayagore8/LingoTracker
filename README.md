LingoTracker

About my project!

I have developed an interactive and user-friendly self-assessment platform called LingoTracker, designed to empower users to evaluate their language proficiency and receive tailored suggestions for improvement. Leveraging a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Flask framework in Python, this web application offers a seamless experience for users seeking to enhance their language skills.

LingoTracker allows users to self-assess their language proficiency across speaking, writing, and reading. Through a thoughtfully crafted form, users can provide input on their comfort level in each aspect of language. The form dynamically generates a comprehensive self-assessment report, offering users a clear understanding of their strengths and areas for improvement. This report serves as a valuable tool to track language development over time.

One of the standout features of LingoTracker is its ability to provide personalized language course recommendations. Based on the proficiency levels indicated in the self-assessment report, the platform suggests suitable language courses that align with users' skill levels and goals. This tailored approach ensures that users receive targeted learning opportunities to enhance their language capabilities effectively.

By utilizing the power of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask), I've created an intuitive and visually appealing interface that enables users to take control of their language learning journey. LingoTracker is not just a self-assessment tool; it's a supportive companion that empowers users to advance their language skills, explore new horizons, and communicate more effectively in a globalized world.
